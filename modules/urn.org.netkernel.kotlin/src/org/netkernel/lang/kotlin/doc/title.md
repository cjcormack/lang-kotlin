# Kotlinâ„¢

The `urn.org.netkernel.lang.kotlin` module provides both a standard library for building NetKernel components using
the [Kotlin programming language](https://kotlinlang.org) and an endpoint for dynamically running Kotlin Scripts in
NetKernel.

Kotlin is a modern language which primarily runs in the JVM (it is also available to be compiled to JS and Native).
